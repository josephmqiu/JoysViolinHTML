    <dl>
        <dt>How much should I practive?</dt>
            <dd>Generally for one to be sucessful you should practice more than 20 minutes a day. If you </dd><br><br>
        <dt>Is violin hard?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. Very difficult to master.</dd><br><br>
        <dt>How long will it take me to be able to play?</dt>
            <dd>That varies from student to student and depends on the individual. The main factors are your age and how much practicing you do. Playing is a physical skill so it does take repetition to improve. Typically, if you start piano lessons in September by December you will be able to play a recognizable Christmas carol. An adult or a teen learning guitar can improve dramatically in a few months. Most students take lessons for the minimum of one year.</dd><br><br>
        <dt> When can I start Lessons?</dt>
            <dd>Private Lessons and classes are ongoing and can be started at anytime. Dance classes have open enrollment until April. 
                (During April, May and early June dance classes prepare for the Dance Concert.) You can register for Summer classes starting in April.  
                Summer classes usually start mid June.</dd><br><br>
        <dt>Can I sit in on my child's private music lesson?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we have an open door policy. It is your choice when to sit in. Some students find it distracting and some work better with Mom or Dad in the room. The teacher will give you some advice on this after they get to know your child.</dd>  <br><br>
        <dt>Can my two children have a music lesson together, or both myself and my child?</dt>
            <dd>Yes - shared lessons are designed for 2 or 3 people of the same level. It is great for people who have the same goals and interests. It is perfect for bands. Popular combinations include: siblings who are close in age, parent-child, couples, and best friends.</dd>  <br><br>
        <dt>Can both my children be in lessons with different teachers at the same time?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we make every effort to accommodate family schedules. Because we have more than one teacher for most instruments parents usually have several days and times to choose from.
