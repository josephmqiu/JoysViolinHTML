        <dt><b>Student 1 Muppets</b></dt>
            <dd>Gonzo is a multi-talented artist who performs outrageous daredevil stunts. Though an odd looking creature, Gonzo takes pride in his uniqueness and enjoys every adventure he goes on with the Muppets including the occasional space voyage. 

                Rowlf the Dog is the Muppet’s resident piano player. One of the Muppets oldest characters, Rowlf rose to stardom by first plugging advertisements for his favorite dog-food brands on the original Muppets show. Rowlf the Dog is not the trusty Muppets sidekick  always ready to help Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and the rest of the Muppets.
